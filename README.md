## Clean code

1. General editing is linted with [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) which helps with basic editing such as tabs vs spaces. You can see the rules in `.editorconfig` file [here](https://github.com/natkalia/dystopias-kodilla-6.2/blob/master/.editorconfig).
2. **HTML**: HTML validation is done with [html-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-validate/).
3. **Styles**: Sass (and CSS) is linted with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/). You can see the rules in `.styleintrc.json` file [here](https://github.com/natkalia/dystopias-kodilla-6.2/blob/master/.stylelintrc.json).
4. **JS**: Javascript is linted with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). You can see the rules in `.eslintrc.json` file [here](https://github.com/natkalia/dystopias-kodilla-6.2/blob/master/.eslintrc.json).
